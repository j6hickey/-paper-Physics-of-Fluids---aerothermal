Due to the costs and limitations of ground-based testing for largescale vehicles, these predictions rely intensively on numerical simulations (CFD). The need of aero-thermal databases, as a fast-response surrogate model for the aero-thermodynamic heating, arises from the practical impossibility of performing unsteady CFD analysis over the entire trajectory due to the large disparity of fluid mechanical and structural time scales. The construction of these databases is based on a representative set of CFD simulations which cover, at a minimum, the flight regimes with significant thermal loads. The aim of this paper is to analyse the results of these representative CFD simulations during both the ascent flight and atmospheric entry for the RETALT1 vehicle to show typical flow field phenomena occurring during these phases and the resulting heating patterns.}, number={3}, journal={CEAS Space Journal}, author={Laureti, Mariasole and Karl, Sebastian}, year={2022}, month=jul, pages={501–515}, language={en} }

As a first approach, the risk is usually evaluated with the slightly conservative NASA Debris Assessment Software (DAS). However, if the DAS assessment of the risk does not meet the NSS guideline of 1:10,000, the higher-fidelity Object Reentry Analysis Survival Tool (ORSAT) might be required. Various versions of this code have been used in the past 10 years to perform over 20 different spacecraft reentry analyses. The object of this paper is to discuss the new features of the latest version – ORSAT 6.0. These features include replacement of the trajectory model and improvement of the gravitational model; incorporation of the GRAM atmosphere and a user-defined atmosphere model; 2-D heating rate and temperature variation around spheres, cylinders, cones, and flat plates; drag coefficients for cones; and general program improvements. Additional improvements include a Graphical User Interface (GUI), gas cap radiation at high entry velocities, recession for non-metallic insulation materials, structural failure of solar array hinges, tank bursting, Unix/Linux plotting scripts, an expanded materials property database, and trajectory mapping on a world map. Sample results are presented for reentry of the Genesis capsule using these updated features in ORSAT.}, booktitle={56th International Astronautical Congress of the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, and the International Institute of Space Law}, publisher={American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics}, author={Dobarco-Otero, J. and Smith, R.

For selected altitudes at 11 points along the flight trajectory of the capsule, lines of sight were extracted from flowfield solutions computed using the high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code Dplr. These lines of sight were used as inputs for the line-by-line radiation code Neqair, and emission spectra of the air plasma were computed in the wavelength range from 300 to 1600 nm, a range that covers all of the different experiments onboard the DC-8. In addition, the computed flowfield solutions were postprocessed with the material thermal response code Fiat, and the resulting surface temperatures of the heat shield were used to generate thermal emission spectra based on Planck radiation. Both spectra were summed and integrated over the flowfield. The resulting emission at each trajectory point was propagated to the DC-8 position and transformed into incident irradiance to be finally compared with experimental data.},

abstract={The need to validate through an in-flight experience the re-entry systems and technologies and their strategic value in the field of space transportation and exploration future mission, led in Europe in the past years to design and develop several experimental vehicles in the frame of National and ESA programs. In this context, the Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP) has been conceived by the ESA Member States to collect and harmonize the know-how gained by the European Space Community and to direct the technical effort and the necessary funds relevant to this matter on the development and the manufacturing of an European Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), a re-entry demonstrator, to be launched at the beginning of the next decade (2012). Among the technological challenges to be demonstrated through the IXV mission, the verification of the advanced Thermal Protection System (TPS) and Hot Structures (HS) in realistic flight conditions represents one of the primary objectives of the IXV project. The selection of the various TPS&HS components and technologies to be embarked on the IXV has been driven by different constraints as the IXV mission requirements, the utilisation of the TPS&HS elements identified as essential for the operations of re-entry vehicles and of the TPS&HS components and technologies under development in Europe which appear the most suitable and promising (with reference to their current TRL) to allow the maximum increase of the TRL as result of the IXV mission. In addition, the same TPS&HS elements shall comply with the vehicle architecture and adequately support the mission at an affordable cost. In order to meet these constraints the need to submit the TPS&HS components and technologies to an IXV dedicated development and qualification program before the flight appears as essential. With reference to the IXV System Requirements Review (SRR) configuration the various TPS&HS elements are presented in terms of design and main performances as well as the verification philosophy and the consequent development and qualification program foreseen at all product levels: material, technology, component, assembly and subsystems up to the involvement in the vehicle system verification.}

This flight represents a unique means of validation of the computational tools employed for the design of such mission. The aim of this paper is to exploit for the first time these data in the rarefied portion of the vehicle’s reentry. In this context, DSMC simulations were performed between 115 and 90 km and a CFD computation was made for the 90 km flight point. In the standard numerical conditions, different degrees of agreement are obtained and a sensitivity analysis to various numerical and atmospheric parameters provides several ways to significantly improve the results. In addition, the DSMC and CFD comparison provides a good agreement for the surface quantities and suggestions to reach a better level of consistency between both methods and the flight data are finally discussed.},

The aerodynamic analysis, carried out for the whole flight scenario, relies on computational fluid dynamics, wind tunnel test, and engineering-based design data generated during the project phases, from rarefied flow conditions, to hypersonic continuum flow up to reach subsonic speeds regime. Therefore, the vehicle aerodynamic database covers the range of Mach number, angle of attack, sideslip and control surface deflections foreseen for the vehicle nominal re-entry. In particular, the databasing activities are developed in the light of build-up approach. This means that all aerodynamic force and moment coefficients are provided by means of a linear summation over certain number of incremental contributions such as, for example, effect of sideslip angle, aerodynamic control surface effectiveness, etc. Each force and moment coefficient is treated separately and appropriate equation is provided, in which all the pertinent contributions for obtaining the total coefficient for any selected flight conditions appear. To this aim, all the available numerical and experimental aerodynamic data are gathered in order to explicit the functional dependencies from each aerodynamic model addend through polynomial expressions obtained with the least squares method. These polynomials are function of the primary variable that drives the phenomenon whereas secondary dependencies are introduced directly into its unknown coefficients which are determined by means of best-fitting algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Reusability Flight Experiment (ReFEx) is currently under development at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). A coupled experimental and numerical campaign was carried out to investigate the surface heating on the payload geometry during return consisting of a forebody and canard. In this way, numerical tools for a post-flight analysis can be preemptively improved where required. Experiments were undertaken at the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen (HEG) on a 1:4 scale model with the use of temperature sensitive paint on the payload geometry to obtain surface heat flux. The model configuration was varied in angle of attack and canard deflection. Laminar and turbulence-model solvers in the DLR-TAU code were used for the numerical simulations. This investigation focussed on the shock–shock interaction of the nose bow shock with the leading-edge shock of the canards showing significant surface heat flux along the canard. Larger surface heat fluxes were measured in the experiments downstream of the shock interaction on the canard, than obtained from the laminar CFD calculations. This was attributed to transition of the boundary layer within the interaction regions, in the presence of significant adverse pressure gradients. Other flow features along the forebody in the vicinity of the canard were qualitatively matched better by the fully-turbulent numerical solutions than the laminar ones. This work aims to demonstrate the extent to which the numerical and experimental tools assist useful insights into flow phenomena during the return stages of the ReFEx payload geometry, and the aspects for which improvements are required.},

The results show that high heat flux is limited in a small region around the stagnation point, and the influence of attack angle on the aero-heating of nose region can be neglected. Because even small sideslip angle may induce great enhanced aero-heating on the windward side of blunted waverider, zero degree sideslip angle is suggested in the present paper. With this assumption, the thermal materials of nose region, leading edge and upper surface can be chosen based on their aero-heating under on-design condition; while for the lower surface, the thermal materials should be determined by the aero-heating under maximum angle of attack.},

In all these cases, the transformation is successful across the entire inner layer of the boundary layer (including the viscous sublayer, buffer layer, and logarithmic layer), recovers the asymptotically exact near-wall behavior in the viscous sublayer, and is consistent with the near balance of turbulence production and dissipation in the logarithmic region of the boundary layer. The performance of the transformation is verified for compressible wall-bounded flows with edge Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 15 and friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 2000.

	title = {Velocity scaling of high-speed turbulent boundary layer flows with wall heat transfer},
	abstract = {The law of the wall has been a staple in collapsing the mean velocity profiles of seemingly very different turbulent channel and boundary layer flows into one single, semi-analytical function. Accordingly, it has equipped engineers and scientists with unique predictive capabilities over the randomness of turbulence. Its universality and widespread success for incompressible canonical flows has further encouraged research efforts that seek transformations that scale any type of flow, whether canonical or not, to match with the law of the wall. In this work, the problem of scaling non-adiabatic boundary layer flows is tackled in the high-speed, compressible context.  
 
Starting from a generalization of the two most successful transformations to date, the Van Driest and Trettel and Larsson, the shortcomings of each transformation are highlighted. Following that, and contrary to most classical approaches, an extension is carried out using the conservation of energy, from which a potential velocity transformation is obtained. In turn, by basing the analysis on energy as opposed to momentum, the resulting transformation explicitly accounts for the non-adiabatic condition at the wall.  
 
The transformation is assessed by comparison against the law of the wall in the case of hypersonic, non-adiabatic boundary layer flows. It is found to yield perfect collapse for weakly-to-moderately cooled walls. After factoring in the higher-order fluctuations in the turbulence terms, the transformation is also found to produce excellent agreement for strongly cooled walls.  
 
The findings demonstrate that the physics of non-adiabatic walls cannot be fully captured by solely relying on the conservation of momentum. In addition, in high-speed flows with large heat transfer at the wall, the higher-order turbulence terms cannot be neglected. Ahead of full-scale implementation, the transformation has to be rigorously tested using broader data sets. This is left for future work.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Strong interactions of shock waves with boundary layers lead to flow separations and enhanced heat transfer rates. When the approaching boundary layer is hypersonic and transitional the problem is particularly challenging and more reliable data is required in order to assess changes in the flow and the surface heat transfer, and to develop simplified models. The present contribution compares results for transitional interactions on a flat plate at Mach 6 from three different experimental facilities using the same instrumented plate insert. The facilities consist of a Ludwieg tube (RWG), an open-jet wind tunnel (H2K) and a high-enthalpy free-piston-driven reflected shock tunnel (HEG). The experimental measurements include shadowgraph and infrared thermography as well as heat transfer and pressure sensors. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are carried out to compare with selected experimental flow conditions. The combined approach allows an assessment of the effects of unit Reynolds number, disturbance amplitude, shock impingement location and wall cooling. Measures of intermittency are proposed based on wall heat flux, allowing the peak Stanton number in the reattachment regime to be mapped over a range of intermittency states of the approaching boundary layer, with higher overshoots found for transitional interactions compared with fully turbulent interactions. The transition process is found to develop from second (Mack) mode instabilities superimposed on streamwise streaks.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of the high-temperature effect, especially the real gas effect and chemical reactions, on hypersonic aerothermodynamic solutions of double cone and double wedge configurations, as well as the fluid–thermal–structural interaction of a double wedge configuration in hypersonic flow. First, a high-temperature computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was benchmarked and correlated with experimental results, emphasizing the impact of high-temperature effects as well as turbulence modeling on heat flux prediction. Subsequently, the multi-fidelity multi-variate Gaussian process regression (M2GPR ) method for problems with high-dimensional outputs was developed to create an aerothermal surrogate model. The model achieves a balance between model accuracy and computational cost of sample generation, using the combination of a few high-fidelity samples and many low-fidelity samples. The numerical examples show that, using the M2GPR formulation, the required number of high-fidelity samples may be reduced by over 80\% while maintaining an accuracy comparable to the high-fidelity CFD solvers. In addition, a geodesic-distance-based metric is developed to inform the choice of high-dimensional datasets of different fidelities for the M2GPR surrogate with improved accuracy. Finally, the aerothermal surrogate was applied to study the impact of the high-temperature effect on the aerothermoelastic response of a hypersonic skin panel, emphasizing the necessity of the accurate characterization of the localized heat flux for reasonable assessment of the response of a compliant structure in high-speed high-temperature flowfield.},

	abstract = {Analysis and simulation of fluid–thermal–structure coupling play an essential role in hypersonic flight vehicle design. In this study, the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) method is employed to establish the reduced-order model (ROM) for a hypersonic panel with a thermal protection system. First, the subsystem of the aerothermoelastic (AETI) system is modeled. Specifically, the aerodynamic heating is calculated with Eckert’s reference enthalpy method. The heat transfer is carried out with the finite difference method, and the aeroelastic equation is built by integrating the von Kármán plate theory and the third-order piston theory. Additionally, the two-way coupling between aerothermal and aeroelastic subsystems is used to construct the AETI system. Second, the optimal snapshots with the resultant local SPOD modes (SPOMs) are evaluated in terms of accuracy. Third, the global SPOMs for variable flight parameters are promoted to develop the robustness of the proposed SPOD/ROM. The findings indicate that taking the transient chaotic response as snapshots can produce global SPOMs. SPOD/ROM for the present AETI system improves the efficiency by 10–50 times compared to the classic Galerkin method. Moreover, the global SPOMs to variable Mach number and flight altitude are essentially the natural modes of the AETI panel, and thus are dependent on the temperature of the fluttering panel, which is our new finding in the present study. Overall, the current research will provide methods for accurately and efficiently predicting thermal loads, flutter boundary, and dynamic response for hypersonic flight vehicles.},

	abstract = {The problem of scaling the near-wall mean velocity profiles of turbulent flows and collapsing them with the law of the wall has been traditionally studied using the conservation of momentum, by employing various levels of assumptions. In the van Driest transformation (“Turbulent Boundary Layer in Compressible Fluids,” Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1951, pp. 145–216), the viscous stress was neglected, whereas in the Trettel and Larsson transformation (“Mean Velocity Scaling for Compressible Wall Turbulence with Heat Transfer,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 28, No. 2, 2016, Paper 026102), the Reynolds stress was assumed to cancel out. Recent work by Griffin, Fu, and Moin (“Velocity Transformation for Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows with and Without Heat Transfer,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 118, No. 34, 2021, Paper e2111144118) used a quasi-equilibrium assumption between turbulence production and dissipation in the log layer and demonstrated success for a wide variety of canonical flows. However, the extent of quasi-equilibrium is not verified, particularly for noncanonical flows. In this work, an alternate transformation is developed using the semilocal gradient of the van Driest transformed velocity, which is principally tied to the dynamics of vorticity transport in the boundary layer. In addition, a modified stress balance is utilized to directly account for and scale the buffer region. The transformation was benchmarked using a similar dataset as in Griffin et al., and comparable performance was obtained. Moreover, at supercritical pressures, the present transformation is found to produce significantly better collapse than existing works.},

	abstract = {Transpiration cooling in a turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate is investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The simulations are performed by solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at low Mach number conditions (M∞=0.3). Both the coolant and the hot gas are air, with isothermal walls and coolant at a temperature of Tw/T∞=0.5, while the blowing ratio and boundary conditions have been varied. These simulations elucidate the turbulence and heat-flux alterations due to the interaction of the coolant with the hot-gas boundary layer. By increasing the blowing ratio, the peak turbulent kinetic energy moves away from the wall to a region of shear between the low-momentum coolant and high-momentum hot gas. The reduction of the wall heat transfer is caused by the combined effects of heat advection due to the non-zero wall-normal velocity at the wall, and the reduction of the average boundary-layer temperature due to the accumulation of coolant. A new model for the latter effect is proposed which is physically realistic in the limit cases. The proposed combined model accounts for both heat advection and film accumulation and shows good agreement with the DNS data. An increase in turbulent transport of heat with increasing blowing rate is caused by the production of vortices between the coolant and hot gas. This causes a reduction in the cooling effectiveness, and can be seen near the leading edge of the transpiration region. In order to investigate wall modelling effects, simulations with uniform coolant injection have been compared to simulations with injection via many small strips. It is observed that as the strips get smaller (at fixed total mass flow rate and fixed wall porosity), the results trend towards the uniform injection case. Therefore, it is hypothesized that for small pore sizes, neglecting the effects of the individual pores in the wall boundary condition is physically justifiable.},

	abstract = {We assess Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulent closures for the prediction of a turbulent boundary layer with transpiration cooling via comparison with a high-fidelity direct numerical simulation database. This study considers the canonical zero-pressure gradient, flat-plate, turbulent boundary layer over a massively cooled wall, with transpiration cooling. The simulations are conducted at a low-subsonic Mach number and we study two transpiration cooling configurations with uniform and slit injection at various blowing ratios. The DNS and RANS simulation setups are nearly identical. The RANS-based turbulence models perform well in the qualitative estimation of the velocity and thermal boundary layer evolution at low-blowing ratios (F = 0.2 and 0.6\%); more significant differences are noted at higher blowing ratios (F=2.0\%). The RANS models, especially the Spalart–Allmaras model, over-predict turbulence production near the wall which results in faster growth in the boundary thickness; this error becomes more pronounced at higher blowing ratios. Despite the greater mixing of momentum, the thermal mixing is under-predicted compared to the DNS in the uniform blowing case but over-predicted for the slit case. These results suggest that modeling errors in the temperature distribution due to turbulent thermal flux modeling can be significant even if the velocity is correctly modeled.},

Two distinct classes of vehicles are reviewed; Hypersonic Transports and Space Launchers, their common features and differences are examined. After a brief historical overview, the paper takes a multi-disciplinary approach to these vehicles, discusses various design aspects, and technical challenges. Operational issues are explored, including mission proﬁles, current and predicted markets, in addition to environmental effects and human factors. Technological issues are also reviewed, focusing on the three major challenge areas associated with these vehicles: aerothermodynamics, propulsion, and structures. In addition, matters of reliability and maintainability are also presented. The paper also reviews the certiﬁcation and ﬂight testing of these vehicles from a global perspective. Finally the current stakeholders in the ﬁeld of hypersonic ﬂight are presented, summarizing the active programs and promising concepts.},

	abstract = {Aerothermoelasticity is one of the key technologies for hypersonic vehicles. Accurate and efﬁcient computation of the aerothermodynamics is one of the primary challenges for hypersonic aerothermoelastic analysis. Aimed at solving the shortcomings of engineering calculation, computation ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) and experimental investigation, a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for aerothermodynamics based on CFD predictions using an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is developed. Both proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and surrogate are considered and compared to construct ROMs. Two surrogate approaches named Kriging and optimized radial basis function (ORBF) are utilized to construct ROMs. Furthermore, an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is proposed, which proves to be helpful to improve the precisions of ROMs. Test results for the three-dimensional aerothermodynamic over a hypersonic surface indicate that: the ROMs precision based on Kriging is better than that by ORBF, ROMs based on Kriging are marginally more accurate than ROMs based on PODKriging. In a word, the ROM framework for hypersonic aerothermodynamics has good precision and efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {The aerothermodynamic environment surrounding bodies undergoing destructive atmospheric entry is characterized by multiple interacting shock waves generated by the presence of several fragments moving close to one another at high speed. Shock interaction and impingement produce highly localized surface loads, influencing the overall dynamics of the fragment, its temperature, and in turn its demise. To account for the relevant physics during the reentry process of fragmenting bodies, a multifidelity framework is presented that allows for selecting the most appropriate level of fidelity, between high-fidelity solutions or low-fidelity aerothermodynamic metamodels. A physics-informed approach is implemented to automatically choose between the two fidelity levels on the basis of the intersection of shock wave envelopes. The complete framework is validated on relevant test cases from the literature and its performance is demonstrated for destructive atmospheric reentry cases, such as the case of the Attitude Vernier Upper Module and the Automated Transfer Vehicle from the European Space Agency.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM) methodology for efficient and accurate modeling of non-linear dynamical systems. The PIROM consists of a physics-based analytical component that represents the known physical processes, and a data-driven dynamical component that represents the unknown physical processes. The PIROM is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE) analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two-three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Moreover, the PIROM-based solver is benchmarked against the conventional POD-kriging surrogate model, and is found to significantly outperform the accuracy, generalizability and sampling efficiency of the latter in a wide range of operating conditions and in the presence of complex structural boundary conditions. Finally, the PIROM-based ATE solver is demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib-supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the dramatic snap-through behavior with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions, but also demonstrates the potential of PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate design and optimization of multi-disciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures.},
